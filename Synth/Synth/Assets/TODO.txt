Synth:
	Modules
		Distributer: Takes the weighted average of the input and normalizes it to 1, then distributes it to the outputs depending on their weights.
		Flip: *-1.
		Sender: Sends the signal to a reciever, which then outputs it after a delay.
		Reciever: Recieves signal from a sender and outputs it after a delay.
		Delay: Delays the signal.
	Fix weird sounds in synth.
	Stuff like LFOs and Envelopes.
	Make all Connections FlexConnections?
	Replace lists in SynthResult with thread-safe containers.

Music:
	Let most music data be in a single object that can then be passed around.
	Load data from multiple files.
